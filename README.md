# MyReads React App

MyReads is a web app created using ReactJS as part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program. MyReads lets you organise your books into three shelves: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read**, and **Read**. You can also search and add new books to your preferred shelf.

## Installation and usage

 - Clone/Download this repository
 - Go to project directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
 - Run `npm start` to start the application at http://localhost:3000



## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
